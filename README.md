# Rain-prediction-system
This project aims to predict rainfall using various machine learning models. The dataset used contains various weather features, and the target variable is whether it will rain or not. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Rainfall.csv`, which contains weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. The target variable is `rainfall`, which is a binary variable indicating whether it rained (`yes`) or not (`no`).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `imblearn`
